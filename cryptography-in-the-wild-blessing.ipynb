    " \n",
    " - Cryptogrqphic libraries are responsible for securing all network communications, yet have produced notoriously severe vulnerabilities.\n",
    " - In 2014, HeartBleed vulnerability in OpenSSL enables attackers to read the content of servers private memory.\n",
    " - In June 2020, GnuTLS suffered a significatn vulnerability allowing a remote attacker to passively decrypt network traffic.\n",
    " - A common aphorism in the security community is 'Cryptographic code is inherintly difficult to secure due to its complexity', another maxim is 'Complexity is the enemy of security'.\n",
    " - Many cryptographic libraries includes code that is not purely cryptographic in nature, including often complex network protocols, data sophistication (e.g. X.509 parsing), and system configuration code.\n",
    " - Novel cryptographic primitives, programming languages abd use-cases suc h as cryptocurrencies and zero-knowledge proofs emerge increasingly in the industry.\n",
    " - An oft-cited strategy to improve security in cryptographic libraries and other systems is to write code in memory-safe languages such as Rust.\n",
